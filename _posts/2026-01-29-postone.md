Since the installation of immich on my homeserver,
there was a new update introduced and i was interested how exactly it is updated.

Turns out, since it's a docker container it is extremely easy to update it with just
one single command in the container folder:

> docker compose pull && docker compose up -d

I got to start using Docker and other containers in my homeserver more.
