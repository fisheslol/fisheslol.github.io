Since i created this blog already after making my first so-called "homeserver" i'm gonna introduce it here.

To start off my homelabbing journey i decided to use my old laptop that i wanted to repurpose for something.
Its specs are:
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 5500U
- **RAM:** 8 GB
- **Storage:** 256 GB SSD
- **OS:** Debian 13

Since this laptop didn't have an Ethernet port, it doesn't support Proxmox and I have decided for Debian and Docker containers to run Nextcloud and Immich to replace my Google One subscription. 
Even though it might be more economical to have the subscription, i want to do this for experience and learn how to build a home server. Although a laptop isn't the best homeserver, it's a more or less a good start.

Right now as of writing this post i am trying to make it as secure as possible to learn security with real experience.

I have already some plans for what to do with it.
